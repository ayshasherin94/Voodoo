                    <h2>Exorcism</h2>
                      <p>
                        Exorcism is the act of driving out, or warding off, demons, or evil spirits, from persons, places, or things, which are believed to be possessed or infested by them, or are liable to become victims or instruments of their malice; (2) the means employed for this purpose, especially the solemn and authoritative adjuration of the demon, in the name of God, or any of the higher power in which he is subject. The word, which is not itself biblical, is derived from exorkizo, which is used in the Septuagint (Genesis 24:3 = cause to swear; III(I) Kings 22:16 = adjure), and in Matthew 26:63, by the high priest to Christ, "I adjure thee by the living God. . ." The non-intensive horkizo and the noun exorkistes (exorcist) occur in Acts 19:13, where the latter (in the plural) is applied to certain strolling Jews who professed to be able to cast out demons. Expulsion by adjuration is, therefore, the primary meaning of exorcism, and when, as in Christian usage, this adjuration is in the name of God or of Christ, exorcism is a strictly religious act or rite. But in ethnic religions, and even among the Jews from the time when there is evidence of its being vogue, exorcism as an act of religion is largely replaced by the use of mere magical and superstitious means, to which non-Catholic writers at the present day sometimes quite unfairly assimilate Christian exorcism. Superstition ought not to be confounded with religion, however much their history may be interwoven, nor magic, however white it may be, with a legitimate religious rite.

                      <h2>Installation of Carbon Monoxide Detectors</h2>
                      <p>
                        One of the most important debunking tools a paranormal investigator can have that the ghost hunting equipment stores don't sell is the Carbon Monoxide tester. They can be expensive and do need to be calibrated from time to time but what better way to help your client, then to save there life.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We us the Carbon Monoxide tester on all of our cases weather winter or summer during the initial walk through while doing base readings and in the middle of the investigation and again at the conclusion of the investigation. Carbon Monoxide poisoning has been found to cause what some mistakenly perceive as paranormal activity, when actually no paranormal activity is present.

Before you freak out and start doing drastic things to get rid of your entity, let's take a look into the different ways that paranormal research has found entities attach themselves to this world.
